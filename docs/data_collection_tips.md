## (Important) Data Collection Tips
### 1. Pay Attention to Tactile / Force Feedback during Teleoperation
Since RDP relies on tactile / force information for real-time responses, 
the collected data have to include such reactive behaviour.
It is important to note that when data collectors become more proficient, 
they may tend to rely only on visual cues and muscle memory to perform the task,
which has to be avoided.

### 2. Align the Settings of Data Collection and Inference
As RDP is an imitation learning algorithm,
if you want to test the model with human perturbations,
it is essential to include such perturbations in the data collection process
to enhance the reactive capability.
